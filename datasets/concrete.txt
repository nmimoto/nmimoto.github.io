Data Type: 
  multivariate

Abstract: 
  Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The
  concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and
  ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,
  water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

Data Characteristics:
  The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a
  specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).

Summary Statistics:
  Number of instances (observations): 1030
  Number of Attributes: 9
  Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable
  Missing Attribute Values: None

Variable Information:
  Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description.
  The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing
  corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Fine             (component 7) Fine Aggregate     -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture
Age                                               -- quantitative -- Day (1~365)
