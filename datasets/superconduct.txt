Data Type:
  multivariate

Data Set Information:

  There are two files: (1) train.csv contains 81 features extracted from 21263
  superconductors along with the critical temperature in the 82nd column,
  (2) unique_m.csv contains the chemical formula broken up for all the 21263
  superconductors from the train.csv file. The last two columns have the
  critical temperature and chemical formula. The original data comes from
  [Web Link] which is public. The goal here is to predict the critical
  temperature based on the features extracted.


Variable Information:




Superplasticizer (component 5)                    -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture
Coarse           (component 6) Coarse Aggregate   -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture
Fine             (component 7) Fine Aggregate     -- quantitative -- kg in a m3 mixture
