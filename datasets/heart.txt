#3  "ChestPain"  (Qualitative) chest pain type
                    -- Value 1: typical angina
                    -- Value 2: atypical angina
                    -- Value 3: non-anginal pain
                    -- Value 4: asymptomatic
#4  "RestBP"     resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
#5  "Chol"       serum cholestoral in mg/dl
#6  "Fbs"        (Qualitative) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
#7  "RestECG"    (Qualitative) resting electrocardiographic results
                    -- Value 0: normal
                    -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
                    -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
#8  "MaxHR"      maximum heart rate achieved
#9  "ExAng"      (Qualitative) exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
#10 "Oldpeak"    oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
#11 "Slope"      the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
#12 "Ca"         number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
#13 "Thal"       (Qualitative) Thalium stress test
                   3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
#14 "AHD"        (Qualitative)(Response) Yes/No based on an angiographic test
                     diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
                     -- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
                     -- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing
                     (in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)
