on the New York Stock Exchange 
and the closing values of the Australian All Ordinaries Index 
of Share Prices, recorded at the termination of trading.  


251 successive trading days

Sep 10, 1993 to Aug 26, 1994


(Because of the time difference between Sydney and New York, 
the markets do not close simultaneously in both places; however, 
in Sydney the closing price of the Dow Jones index for the previous
day is known before the opening of the market on any trading day.)
