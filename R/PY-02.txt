#--- Check current working directory

print(path)

print(type(path))

  # os.chdir("/Users/username/Folder1")  # change dir
  # os.chdir("C:\\Users\\UserName\\Folder1")

a = [1, 3, 5]
b = a
print(a)
print(b)
a = [x + 2 for x in a]
print(b is a)
print(a)
print(b)   # b is not same as a

#--- I/O with Python
Infile = open('SOA-Orig-Porb.txt')
Infile.read()   # one single string of everything in the file.
Infile.read()   # returns nothing because the cursor is at the EoF
Infile.seek(0)  # reset cursor
Infile.read()   # now it can read again

Infile.seek(0)
Infile.readlines() # each line is separate entry in one list

Infile.close()



#- I/O Another way (you don't have to .close() this way)
with open('SOA-Orig-Prob.txt', mode='r') as Infile:
    contents  = Infile.read()
with open('SOA-Orig-Prob-02.txt', mode='w') as Outfile1:
    Outfile1.write(contents)


#- I/O as list
with open('SOA-Orig-Prob.txt', mode='r') as Infile:
    contents = Infile.readlines()
with open('SOA-Orig-Prob-03.txt', mode='w') as Outfile:
    #Outfile.write(contents2)  # gives error because it's list, not string
    str01  = ' '.join(map(str, contents))
    Outfile.write(str01)
