1. Form a gorup of less than 4 students.  



2. Pick a dataset to work on.  You can use dataset listed under
"Data List" on class webpage, or you can find something on the web.
If you happen to have time series data (say, from your work)
you can use them as well.

The dataset must be approved for the project.
When you make a decision, email me.



3.  You are exptected to do:

Find best SARIMA model that fits the data.

Write report in MS Word explaining how you arrived at the final model.

Report can not be more than 5 pages, including output, and figures.

Key output, and key plots should be included,
but you must carefully choose what to include. 
Don't just include all the plots, or just omit all the outputs.  

R code should be attached at the end.  Code is not counted toward 5 pages.




4.  You can refer to Modeling Guidelines.

Below are list of general questions that you need to answer in your report.  

  Seasonality?
  
  Stationality?  Do you need d=1? D=1? Both?
  
  Need Transformation? (log)
  
  Linear Trend or Random Trend?
  
  Order selection of ARMA(p,q)x(P,Q)
