AR(p) and MA(q) model

  Formula for Theoretical ACF and ACVF of AR(1), and MA(1)


  Condition for AR(p) to be causal process
  Condition for MA(q) to be invertible process
    Given the model equation, use R to check for causality/invertibility
    what does causal/invertible process mean?
    why is it important?


  Yule-Walker Equation
    Derivation
    PACF
    Solution to the equation under AR(p)


  Model Diagnostics
    Parameter Significance
    AIC and AICc
    When is a model adequate?
    What metrics do you use to decide which model is better?
