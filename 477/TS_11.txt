# 1. 
# -----------------
# Read in dowj.txt file.  Plot the time series. 
# Does the plot looks stationary?  
# Plot ACF and PACF of the series. 
# Test for the stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit-Root test.




# 2. 
# -----------------
# Take the difference of dowj data. Plot the time series. 
# Does the plot looks stationary?  
# Plot ACF and PACF of the series. 
# What does ADF test say about stationarity?




# 3. 
# -----------------
# Take additional difference of dowj data. Plot the time series. 
# Does the plot looks stationary?  
# Plot ACF and PACF of the series. 
# What does ADF test say about stationarity?








# 2-b. 
# -----------------
# Now based on what we saw in question 2, model the origianl dowj data
# with ARIMA(p, 1, q).  
# Use auto.arima() in forecast package to choose p and q based on AICc.  
# Diagnose the model fit.  Is the model fitting well? All the parameters significant?
# If not, manually search for better value of p and q.  





# 2-c. 
# -----------------
# Using the model you came up in the previous question, give 5-day prediction 
# of dowj value.  Plot the data(black) and predictioin(red) on the same plot.
# The range of x-axis must be suitablly chosen. 





# 2-d. 
# -----------------
# In part (2-b), your ARIMA parameter estimation gave standard errors for 
# estimation.  Can you trust that number?  Why?  How would you verify?






# 3-b. 
# -----------------
# Now based on what we saw in question 3, model the origianl dowj data
# with ARIMA(p, 2, q).  
# Use auto.arima() in forecast package to choose p and q based on AICc.  
# Diagnose the model fit.  Is the model fitting well? All the parameters significant?
# If not, manually search for better value of p and q.  




# 3-c. 
# -----------------
# Using the model you came up in the previous question, give 5-day prediction 
# of dowj value.  Plot the data(black) and predictioin(red) on the same plot.
# The range of x-axis must be suitablly chosen. 






# 4. (optional)
# -----------------
# Can you come up with some other way of fitting the dowj model?  
# 
 






# 5. 
# -----------------
# Which model do you like better (2-b), (3-b) or 4? 
# Why?
