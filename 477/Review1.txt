1. Autocorrelation

   What does autocorrelation mean?

   What happens to sample mean if the series is correlated?

   Given a series, how do you directly demonstrate (plot) an autocorrelation of lag 1?

   Definition of sample ACF and sample ACVF

   Given data, how do you check for autocorrelation?

   How do you plot ACF and ACVF in R?

   How do you determine if sample ACF is significant?

   What is the difference between White Noise and IID noise

   Definition of weak stationarity
   How do you visually check for stationarity?

   Random Trend. Give an example.
   Deterministic Trend. Give an example.

   Random Walk without drift
   Random Walk with drift

   (Given data, how do you look for sign that it is a random walk?)
   (Given data, how do you look for sign that it is a linear trend + WN?)
